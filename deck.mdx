# 🐕 Lyca

<a href="https://elated-cori-1eb692.netlify.com/" target="_blank"><img src="images/lyca.png" alt="Lyca website" /></a>

```notes
- ** Intro **
- Explain what Lyca is
- ** Problems **
- Clients were React based
- CSS was a mess
- Design needs required something custom
- Friendly to developers who didn't use CSS
- Move fast
- Need constraints to future-proof
- Small and simple for high resusability because of its shared nature
- **Walkthrough**
- **Explain what I like and don't like**
- Design tokens become a first-class citizen
- Consistent props
- Not writing classnames
- Not writing CSS that is dependent on HTML
- Encapsulation of styling, no context switching or class hunting
- Composing is far easier, not writing new CSS
```
